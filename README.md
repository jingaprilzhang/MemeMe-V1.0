# MemeMe-V1.0
Udacity iOS NanoDegree Project 2 V1.0

Created an app that enables a user to take a picture or choose from a photo album, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. Memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

Organized an image view overlaid by two text fields, one near the top and one near the bottom of the image. This view has a bottom toolbar with two buttons: one for the camera and one for the photo album. The top navigation bar has a share left button displaying Apple’s stock share icon and a “Cancel” right button.

Covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.
